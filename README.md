# Pink-Tax-on-online-shopping-platforms
Pink tax refers to the different pricing for consumers of different genders in products that are functionally identical or similar, usually women need to pay higher prices. In order to reveal the existence of pink tax more intuitively, we used Python to write a web crawler to collect a large amount of product price data of similar products for women and men, as well as pink and all colours on Jingdong(京东). We also collect price data of certain products that can be substituted for each other, then cleaned and analysed these data. At the same time, we also carried out word frequency analysis of the discussion about pink tax on Douban(豆瓣).
